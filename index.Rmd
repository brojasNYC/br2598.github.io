Hello, I am an M.S. student at the Biostatistics department at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.

I am also work for Columbia Mailman as the Development Coordinator at the Office of Development and Alumni Relations, assisting with scholarship, student support, and research fundraising.

I'm interested in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). I'd like to help bridge the gap between Neuroscience, psychology, and Public Health.
